This is my version of the Udacity FEND Project 3 Game Frogger.

## Download & Installation

This game can be run offline in your browser, all you need to do is download the source code here and open the index.html in your favorite browser (Google Chrome is recommended).

## Gameplay

- All 5 characters of your team have to reach the water to get to the next level.
- Move your character with the Arrow keys '&larr;, &rarr;, &uarr;, &darr;'.
- On the way you have to avoid bugs which cross the game on the stone bricks from left and right.
- Each player has a different "value" when reaching the water. The princess (5th) having the most.
- Collecting gems will give you extra points.

## Lookout

So far there are only two different levels, since I'm carrying on with the next assignments in the FEND ;). I'm planning to implement the following:
 
- More levels
- Different gems
- Obstacles
- 1Ups
- Cheat codes (just for the fun of it)
